# Berkeley Capstone project - Convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs
This is the final Capstone project for the Berkeley professional certificate in Machine learning and artificial intelligence program, for this final project I followed the CRISP-DM model to develop a Machine learning model that can be used to identify traffic signs

A key component of Autonomous vehicles is the accurate detection and interpretation of traffic signs, as it plays a crucial role in enabling these vehicles to navigate intelligently and interact seamlessly with their surroundings. In addition, safety is a critical requirement for autonomous vehicles so the accurate recognition of traffic signs is vital for the proper operation of these vehicles.

in this exercise, we implemented a convolutional neural network using the Kaggle dataset GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark, which is a multi-class, single-image classification dataset. since this is a scholastic exercise we aim to achieve >90% on tets accuracy
